# 🎯 Module 1: Advanced Feature Engineering

## Overview

This module focuses on transforming raw data into powerful predictive features using automated pipelines and advanced transformation techniques.

## 📚 Notebooks

### 01_feature_engineering_basics.ipynb
- Introduction to feature engineering concepts
- Polynomial feature generation
- Interaction term creation
- Basic feature transformations

### 02_custom_transformers.ipynb
- Building custom scikit-learn transformers
- Domain-specific feature engineering
- Creating reusable transformation components
- Integration with pipelines

### 03_pipeline_optimization.ipynb
- Complete pipeline construction
- Feature scaling and normalization strategies
- Missing value imputation techniques
- Performance optimization

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

- **Polynomial Features**: Generate higher-degree polynomial combinations
- **Interaction Terms**: Create features from feature combinations
- **Custom Transformers**: Build domain-specific transformations
- **Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly combine all transformations
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize features for better model performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures, StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create a basic feature engineering pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('poly', PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])
```

## 📌 Coming Soon

- Jupyter notebooks with hands-on examples
- Sample datasets
- Best practices guide
- Performance benchmarks
